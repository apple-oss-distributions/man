#
# This file is read by man to configure the default manpath (also used
# when MANPATH contains an empty substring), and to indicate support for
# a given locale.  The following configuration variables are supported:
#
# MANCONFIG		config_file_glob
# MANPATH		manpath_element
# MANLOCALE		locale
#
# It is assumed that catdirs are equal to a mandir within a given manpath, i.e.,
# share/man/man1 => share/man/cat1.
#
# Every automatically generated MANPATH includes these fields
#
MANPATH	/usr/share/man
MANPATH	/usr/local/share/man
MANPATH	/usr/X11/man
MANPATH	/Library/Apple/usr/share/man
#
# Uncomment if you want to include one of these by default
#
# MANPATH	/opt/*/man
# MANPATH	/usr/lib/*/man
# MANPATH	/usr/share/*/man
# MANPATH	/usr/kerberos/man
#
# Useful paths - note that COL should not be defined when
# NROFF is defined as "groff -Tascii" or "groff -Tlatin1";
# not only is it superfluous, but it actually damages the output.
# For use with utf-8, NROFF should be "nroff -mandoc" without -T option.
# (Maybe - but today I need -Tlatin1 to prevent double conversion to utf8.)
#
# If you have a new troff (version 1.18.1?) and its colored output
# causes problems, add the -c option to TROFF, NROFF, JNROFF.
#
# Uncomment these if you have installed groff manually.  Note that man(1) will
# not provide defaults for any of these tools; their paths must be specified
# here, and we require absolute paths to make sure we use the correct tools.
#
# TROFF		/usr/local/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc -c
# NROFF		/usr/local/bin/groff -Wall -mtty-char -Tascii -mandoc -c
# EQN		/usr/local/bin/eqn -Tps
# TBL		/usr/local/bin/tbl
# REFER		/usr/local/bin/refer
# PIC		/usr/local/bin/pic

#
# The default MANPAGER is less(1), while the default WHATISPAGER for whatis and
# apropos remains more(1) for historical compatibility.  This can either
# be switched in the environment, or globally on a system by setting MANPAGER or
# WHATISPAGER:
#
# MANPAGER	/usr/bin/less -s
# WHATISPAGER	/usr/bin/more -E
#
# The output width can also be adjusted to either the literal value "tty" or a
# fixed column size, like so:
#
# MANWIDTH	120
#
# MANWIDTH=tty is the default setting if run in a terminal, which will instruct
# man(1) to detect the terminal size in columns and use that.
#
# Default manual sections (and order) to search if -S is not specified
# and the MANSECT environment variable is not set.

MANSECT		1:1p:8:2:3:3p:4:5:6:7:9:0p:tcl:n:l:p:o
